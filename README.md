# Statistical-Impact-of-tax-rate-on-health

**Introduction:**

This study examines the relationship between restaurant and grocery tax rates and the prevalence of diabetes/obesity, addressing a notable gap in current research. With diabetes/obesity posing a significant global health challenge, understanding the impact of tax policies on food establishments becomes crucial for informed public health interventions. While extensive research has explored various determinants of diabetes/obesity, the specific role of tax rates on these establishments remains largely unexplored. This study aims to contribute to existing knowledge by investigating the potential link between tax policies and diabetes/obesity prevalence, providing insights for policymakers and healthcare professionals. The following sections detail our methodology, regression models, and implications of our findings.

**Methods:**

1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning
3. EDA
4. Multiple Regression Model
5. Model Validation and Assumption

**Results:**
The final model in our study, 
1.	On diabeticâ€™s percentage as response and predictor variable Tax Delta and control variable age and population, reveal that the coefficient of tax delta is statistically significant, and 1 unit increase in tax delta decreases the ((diabetics^0.51)-1)/0.51 by 2.31%. The exact magnitude of change in diabetics % cannot be predicted due to the transformation. 
2.	On obesity percentage as response and predictor variable Tax Delta and control variable age and population, reveal that the coefficient of tax delta is statistically significant, and 1 unit increase in tax delta decreases the ((obesity^0.14)-1)/0.14 by 0.27%. The exact magnitude of change in diabetics % cannot be predicted due to the transformation.
